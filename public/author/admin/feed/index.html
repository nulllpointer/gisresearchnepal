				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate existence is a myth. For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. The languages only differ in their grammar, their pronunciation and their most common words.</p>
<p>Everyone realizes why a new common language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive translators. To achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform grammar, pronunciation and more common words.</p>
<p>If several languages coalesce, the grammar of the resulting language is more simple and regular than that of the individual languages.</p>
